      <p>Welcome to Idius’s Privacy Policy&nbsp; We suggest you read this in conjunction with our <u>Terms and Conditions of Use.</u> Thank you for taking the time to read it. Whilst you're enjoying the Idius mobile application ("App"), we collect some information about you. In addition, you may choose to use the App to share information with other users, including your friends and contacts ("Users"). We may also need to share your information sometimes.</p>

      <p>We appreciate that you trust us with your information and we intend to always keep that trust. This starts
        with making sure you understand the information we collect, why we collect it, how it is used and your
        choices regarding your information. This Policy describes our privacy practices in plain language,
        keeping legal and technical jargon to a minimum.</p>

      <p>Idius is a global app, and your information will be sent to and used in the Canada regardless of the country you reside in. This Policy explains how we protect your personal data when we transfer it overseas, so please read very carefully! If you have any questions or comments about this Policy, please feel free to contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hello@idius.app">hello@idius.app</a>.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>EFFECTIVE DATE: December 6, 2022<br /></p>

      <p><strong>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p>

      <p>We collect information generated as you use our services, for example, access logs, as well as information from third parties, like when you access our services through a social media account. If you want additional info, we go into</p>
      <p>more detail below.</p>

      <p><strong>User information&nbsp;</strong></p>

      <p>You choose to give us certain information when using our services. When you create an account, you provide us with at least your login credentials, as well as some basic details necessary for the service to work, such as your gender and date of birth. When you complete your profile, you can share with us additional information, such as details on your personality, lifestyle, interests and other details about you, as well as content such as photos and videos. To add certain content, like pictures or videos, you may allow us to access your camera or photo album. Some of the information you choose to provide us may be considered “special” or “sensitive” in certain jurisdictions, for example your racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientation and religious beliefs. By choosing to provide this information, you consent to our processing of that information.</p>

      <p>When you participate in surveys, focus groups or market studies, you give us your insights into products and services, responses to our questions and testimonials. When you choose to participate in our promotions, events or contests, we collect the information that you use to register or enter. If you contact our customer care team, we collect the information you give us during the interaction. Sometimes, we monitor or record these interactions for training purposes and to ensure a high quality of service. If you ask us to communicate with or otherwise process information of other people (for example, if you ask us to send an email on your behalf to one of your friends), we collect the information about others that you give us in order to complete your request. Of course, we also process your chats with other users as well as the content you publish, as part of the operation of the services.</p>

      <p><strong>Additional information</strong></p>

      <p>In addition to the information you provide us directly, we receive information about you from others. Other users may provide information about you as they use our services. For instance, we may collect information about you from other users if they contact us about you.. We may receive info about you from our partners, for instance where Idius ads are published on a partner’s websites and platforms (in which case they may pass along details on a campaign’s success).</p>

      <p>When you use our services, we collect information about which features you’ve used, how you’ve used them and the devices you use to access our services. We collect information about your activity on our services, for instance how you use them (e.g., date and time you logged in, features you’ve been using, searches or search parameters, clicks and pages which have been shown to you, referring webpage address, advertising that you click on) and how you interact with other users (e.g., users you connect and interact with, time and date of your exchanges, number of messages you send and receive).</p>

      <p>We collect information from and about the device(s) you use to access our services, including: hardware and software information such as IP address, device ID and type, device ccspecific and apps settings and characteristics, app crashes, advertising IDs (such as Google’s AAID and Apple's IDFA, both of which are randomly generated numbers that you can reset by going into your device’ settings), browser type, version and language, operating system, time zones, identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser (e.g., IMEI/UDID and MAC address); and information on your wireless and mobile network connection, like your service provider and signal strength.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>If you give us permission, we will be able to collect your precise geolocation (latitude and longitude) in order to offer you features that make use of it. Such geolocation is collected through various means, depending on the service and device you’re using, including GPS, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections. If you decline permission for us to collect your geolocation, we will not collect it. Similarly, if you consent, we may collect your photos and videos (for instance, if you want to publish a photo, video or streaming on the services).&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Please be careful about posting sensitive details about yourself on your profile. While you may voluntarily provide this information to us when you create your profile, there is no requirement to do so. Please remember that photographs that you post on Idius may reveal information about yourself as well. Where you do upload and choose to tell us sensitive information about yourself, including through adding certain information to your profile, you are explicitly consenting to our processing of your information and making this public to other users. When you post information about yourself or use the messaging function, the amount of personal information you share is at your own risk.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Data Storage</strong></p>
      
      <p>By using the App, you acknowledge that Idius is a global app operating through servers located in a number of countries around the world, including the Canada. If you live in a country with data protection laws, the storage of your personal data may not provide you with the same protections as you enjoy in your country of residence</p>

      <p><strong>Geolocation Information</strong></p>

      <p>If you turn these features on, when you use your mobile, we will collect information about WiFi access points as well as other location information about your longitude and latitude and may save your device's coordinates to offer certain features to you. This information helps us identify your physical location and we may use it to personalise the App and make it easier for you to interact with other Users, by enabling the information to be displayed and shared with other members choosing to view “nearby” posts.</p>

      <p>If you have enabled location services, but wish to turn them off, you can do so by the following methods:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>iPhone app — settings, privacy, location services, Idius</li>
        <li>Android — settings, location, Idius, permissions, location</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Log and Usage Data</strong></p>

      <p>We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes and as permitted by applicable law.</p>

      <p>In practice, we delete or anonymise your information upon deletion of your account (following the safety retention window), unless:</p>
      <ul >
        <li>we must keep it to comply with applicable law (for instance, some “traffic data” is kept for one year to comply with statutory data retention obligations);</li>
        <li>we must keep it to evidence our compliance with applicable law (for instance, records of consents to our Terms, Privacy Policy and other similar consents are kept for five years);</li>
        <li>there is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep the relevant information until it is resolved; or</li>
        <li>the information must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention and enhancing users' safety and security. For example, information may need to be kept to prevent a user who was banned for unsafe behaviour or security incidents from opening a new account.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Where Idius uses machine learning, for example, to help us develop a better matching system to provide you with the Idius social networking service, we may need to keep personal information for a longer period than the retention periods explained above, to enable the machine learning to work properly. Where this is the case, we always seek to minimise the amount of personal information that is used and we ensure that it is ring-fenced and kept securely from other user personal information. We regularly review the period for which personal information is required for machine learning purposes and delete any identifiable information when it is no longer required.</p>

      <p><strong>Links</strong></p>
      
      <p>We may keep track of how you interact with links available on Idius including third party services and clients by redirecting clicks or through other means. We may share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.</p>

      <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>

      <p>Cookies are small files transferred to your computer's hard disk based on sites or apps you access. They typically contain information about the source of the cookie, and if or when the cookie will expire.

Cookies store information about your website visits and can recognise you and your preferences each time you visit the Idius site. They help us to provide a better service to you.</p>

      <p>If for any reason you decide that you do not want all of your Idius activities to be stored you may set your browser and mobile settings to block cookies and local storage devices, but please remember that if you do so, you may not be able to access all of the features Idius offers.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>These are specific for web browsers, and since Idius &nbsp;is a mobile-web app there are a few limited use-cases for cookies on Idius:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>When you visit our help center, you are redirected from the app to our Idius Support Center</li>
        <li>When you visit Idiusconnect.com through a web browser (like Safari or Chrome)</li>
      </ul>

        </p>
      
      <p><strong>3. HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION</strong></p>
      
      <p>Since our goal is to help you make meaningful connections, the main sharing of users’ information is with other people, as per your privacy settings in the limited circumstances:&nbsp;</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>With your consent or at your request:&nbsp;</strong>If &nbsp;you consent to share your information with third parties, such as when you use a third party web client or application to access your Account.&nbsp;</li>
        <li><strong>With other people:&nbsp;</strong>We share your information with other people as per your privacy settings (and in the case of any sharing features available on Idius, the individuals or apps with whom you may choose to share your information with) when you voluntarily disclose information on the service (including your public profile). Please be careful with your information and make sure that the content you share is stuff that you’re comfortable being publicly viewable since neither you nor we can control what others do with your information once you share it..</li>
        <li><strong>With our service providers and partners: &nbsp;</strong>We use third parties to help us operate and improve our services. These third parties assist us with various tasks, including data hosting and maintenance, analytics, customer care, marketing, advertising, payment processing and security operations. We may also share information with partners who distribute and assist us in advertising our services. For instance, we may share limited information on you after anonymizing to advertising partners. We follow a strict vetting process prior to engaging any service provider or working with any partner. All of our service providers and partners must agree to strict confidentiality obligations.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment Processing and Telecommunications Companies</strong>:&nbsp;to facilitate payment for our premium service.&nbsp;</li>
        <li><strong>Law and Harm:&nbsp;</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>We may disclose your information if reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant, government / law enforcement investigation or other legal requirements; (ii) to assist in the prevention or detection of crime (subject in each case to applicable law); or (iii) to protect the safety of any person.</li>
            <li>We may also share information: (i) if disclosure would mitigate our liability in an actual or threatened lawsuit; (ii) as necessary to protect our legal rights and legal rights of our users, business partners or other interested parties; (iii) to enforce our agreements with you; and (iv) to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers</strong>: In the event that Idius undergoes a business transition or change of ownership, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, re-organisation, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, or in the event of insolvency or administration, we may be required to disclose your personal data.</li>
        <li><strong>Aggregated Information</strong>:&nbsp;We may use and share non-personal information (meaning information that, by itself, does not identify who you are such as device information, general demographics, general behavioral data, geolocation in de-identified form), as well as personal information in hashed, non-human readable form, under any of the above circumstances. We may also share this information with &nbsp;other third parties (notably advertisers) to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our services and on websites or applications of third parties, and to analyze and report on advertising you see. We may combine this information with additional non-personal information or personal information in hashed, non-human readable form collected from other sources</li>
      </ul>


      <p><strong>4. YOUR RIGHTS</strong></p>
      <p>We want you to be in control of your information, so we have provided you with the following tools:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Access / Update tools in the service. Tools and account settings that help you to access, rectify or delete information that you provided to us and that’s associated with your account directly within the service. If you have any question on those tools and settings, please contact our customer care team.</li>
        <li>Device permissions. Mobile platforms have permission systems for specific types of device data and notifications, such as phone book and location services as well as push notifications. You can change your settings on your device to either consent or oppose the collection of the corresponding information or the display of the corresponding notifications. Of course, if you do that, certain services may lose full functionality.</li>
        <li>Deletion. You can delete your account by using the corresponding functionality directly on the service.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We want you to be aware of your privacy rights. Here are a few key points to remember:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reviewing your information. Applicable privacy laws may give you the right to review the personal information we keep about you (depending on the jurisdiction, this may be called right of access, right of portability or variations of those terms). You can request a copy of your personal information by emailing us.</li>
        <li>Updating your information. If you believe that the information we hold about you is inaccurate or that we are no longer entitled to use it and want to request its rectification, deletion or object to its processing, please contact us.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer the above requests.</p>

      <p>Keep in mind, we may reject requests for certain reasons, including if the request is unlawful or if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property or the privacy of another user. If you wish to receive information relating to another user, such as a copy of any messages you received from him or her through our service, the other user will have to contact our Privacy Officer to provide their written consent before the information is released.</p>

      <p>Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to the processing of personal information, notably where such requests would not allow us to provide our service to you anymore. For instance, we cannot provide our service if we do not have your date of birth.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Uninstall. You can stop all information collection by an app by uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process for your device. If you uninstall the app from your mobile device, the unique identifier associated with your device will continue to be stored. If you re-install the application on the same mobile device, we will be able to re-associate this identifier to your previous transactions and activities.</li>
        <li>Accountability. In certain countries, including in the European Union, you have a right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority if you have concerns about how we process your personal information. The data protection authority you can lodge a complaint with notably may be that of your habitual residence, where you work or where we are established.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>5. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>

      <p>We work hard to protect you from unauthorized access to or alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information. As with all technology companies, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information will always remain secure.</p>

      <p>We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks and regularly review our information collection, storage and processing practices to update our physical, technical and organizational security measures.</p>

      <p>We may suspend your use of all or part of the services without notice if we suspect or detect any breach of security. If you believe that your account or information is no longer secure, please notify us immediately.</p>

      <p><strong>6. HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>

      <p>We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes (as laid out in Section 2 and as permitted by applicable law.</p>

      <p>In practice, we delete or anonymize your information upon deletion of your account, unless:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>we must keep it to comply with applicable law;</li>
        <li>we must keep it to evidence our compliance with applicable law;</li>
        <li>there is an outstanding or potential issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep the relevant information until it is resolved; or</li>
        <li>the information is kept for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention and enhancing users' safety and security. For example, information may need to be kept to prevent a user who was banned for unsafe behavior or security incidents from opening a new account.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Keep in mind that even though our systems are designed to carry out data deletion processes according to the above guidelines, we cannot promise that all data will be deleted within a specific timeframe due to technical constraints.</p>

      <p><strong>12. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</strong></p>
      <p>Our services are restricted to users who are 17 years of age or older. We do not permit users under the age of 17 on our platform and we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 17. If you suspect that a user is under the age of 17 please use the reporting mechanism available through the service.</p>

      <p><strong>13. PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES</strong></p>
      <p>Because we’re always looking for new and innovative ways to help you build meaningful connections, this policy may change over time. We will notify you before any material changes take effect so that you have time to review the changes.</p>
