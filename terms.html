            <p><strong>Idius Terms and Conditions of Use</strong></p>
            <p>Welcome to Idius. As used in this Agreement, the terms “Idius,” “us,” “we,” the “Company”,
            and “our” shall refer to Idius, as appropriate.
            Please take a few moments to read these Terms before using the App, because once you access, 
            view or use the App, you are going to be legally bound by these Terms.
            </p>
            <p><strong>1. Idius RULES&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p>By using our Services, you represent and warrant that:</p>
            <ol style=>
            <li>You are at least 17 years old;</li>
            <li>You are to&nbsp;be legally permitted to use the App by the laws of your home country.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>By accessing or using our Services on www.Idiusconnect.com (the “Website”), the Idius mobile application (the “App”), or any other platforms or services Idius may offer (collectively, the “Service” or our “Services”), you agree to, and are bound by, these Terms of Use (the “Terms” or “Agreement”). This Agreement applies to anyone who accesses or uses our Services, regardless of registration or subscription status.</p>
            <p>Your use of our Services is also subject to the&nbsp;Privacy&nbsp;and&nbsp;Cookie&nbsp;Policies, and any terms disclosed and agreed to 
            by you when you purchase additional features, products, or services from Idius (“Additional Terms Upon Purchase”), which are incorporated 
            into this Agreement by reference. If you do not wish to be bound by this Agreement, do not use our Services.
            </p>
            <p>We reserve the right to modify, amend, or change the Terms at any time. Notice of any material change will be posted on this page 
            with an updated effective date. In certain circumstances, we may notify you of a change to the Terms via email or other means, 
            as appropriate under the circumstances; however, you are responsible for regularly checking this page for notice of any changes.
            We agree that future changes will not be retroactive without your consent. Your continued use of our Services constitutes your 
            acceptance of any change, and you will be legally bound by the updated Terms. If you do not accept a change to the terms, you should 
            stop using our Services immediately.
            </p>
            <p>You can delete your account at any time by logging into the App, going to the “Settings” tab, and selecting “Account”, and following the instructions to terminate your membership. However, you will need to cancel / manage any External Service Purchases through your External Service Account (e.g., iTunes, Google Play) to avoid additional billing.</p>
            <p>Idius reserves the right to investigate and, if appropriate, suspend or terminate your account without a refund if you have violated these Terms, misused our Services, or behaved in a way that Idius regards as inappropriate or unlawful, on or off our Services. We reserve the right to make use of any personal, technological, legal, or other means available to enforce the Terms (including without limitation blocking specific IP addresses), at any time without liability and without the obligation to give you prior notice, including, but not limited to, preventing you from accessing the Services.</p>
            <p>If your account is terminated by you or by Idius for any reason, these Terms continue and remain enforceable between you and Idius, and you will not be entitled to any refund for purchases made. Your information will be maintained and deleted in accordance with our&nbsp;Privacy Policy.</p>

            <p><strong>7. RIGHTS YOU GRANT Idius</strong></p>
            <p>By creating an account, you grant to Idius a worldwide, perpetual, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free right and license to host, store, use, copy, display, reproduce, adapt, edit, publish, translate, modify, and distribute Your Content, including any information you authorize us to access from Facebook or other third party source (if applicable), in whole or in part, and in any format or medium currently known or developed in the future. Idius’s license to Your Content shall be non-exclusive, except that Idius’s license shall be exclusive with respect to derivative works created through use of our Services. For example, Idius would have an exclusive license to screenshots of our Services that include Your Content.</p>
            <p>In addition, so that Idius can prevent the use of Your Content outside of our Services, you authorize Idius to act on your behalf with respect to infringing uses of Your Content taken from our Services by other users or third parties. This expressly includes the authority, but not the obligation, to send notices pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3) (i.e., DMCA Takedown Notices) on your behalf if Your Content is taken and used by third parties outside of our Services. Idius is not obligated to take any action with regard to use of Your Content by other users or third parties. Idius’s license to Your Content is subject to your rights under applicable law (for example, laws regarding personal data protection to the extent the content contains personal information as defined by those laws).</p>
            <p>In consideration for Idius allowing you to use our Services, you agree that we, our affiliates, and our third-party partners may place advertising on our Services. By submitting suggestions or feedback to Idius regarding our Services, you agree that Idius may use and share such feedback for any purpose without compensating you.</p>

            <p>You agree that Idius may access, preserve, and disclose your account information, including Your Content, if required to do so by law or upon a good faith belief that such access, preservation, or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with legal process; (ii) enforce these Terms; (iii) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; (iv) respond to your requests for customer service; or (v) protect the rights, property or personal safety of the Company or any other person.</p>

            <p><strong>8. EXTERNAL SERVICE PURCHASES; PREMIUM SERVICES; IN-APP PURCHASES</strong></p>

            <p>Idius may offer products and services for purchase through iTunes, Google Play or other external services authorized by Idius (each, an “External Service,” and any purchases made thereon, an “External Service Purchase”).&nbsp;If you purchase a subscription, it will automatically renew until you cancel, in accordance with the terms disclosed to you at the time of purchase, as further described below.&nbsp;If you cancel your subscription, you will continue to have access to your subscription benefits until the end of your subscription period, at which point is will expire.</p>

            <p>Because our Services may be utilized without a subscription, canceling your subscription does not remove your profile from our Services. If you wish to fully terminate your membership, you must terminate your membership as set forth in</p>
            <p>“Settings”.</p>
            <p>When making a purchase on the Service, you may have the option to pay through an External Service, such as with your Apple ID or Google account (“your External Service Account”), and your External Service Account will be charged for the purchase in accordance with the terms disclosed to you at the time of purchase and the general terms applicable to your External Service Account. Some External Services may charge you sales tax, depending on where you live, which may change from time to time.</p>

            <p>If your External Service Purchase includes an automatically renewing subscription, your External Service Account will continue to be periodically charged for the subscription until you cancel. After your initial subscription commitment period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, the subscription will automatically continue for the price and time period you agreed to when subscribing.</p>

            <p>To cancel a subscription: If you do not want your subscription to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, you must log in to your External Service Account and follow instructions to manage or cancel your subscription, even if you have otherwise deleted your account with us or if you have deleted the App from your device. For example, if you subscribed using your Apple ID, cancellation is handled by Apple, not Idius. To cancel a purchase made with your Apple ID, go to Settings &gt; iTunes &amp; App Stores &gt; [click on your Apple ID] &gt; View Apple ID &gt; Subscriptions, then find your Idius subscription and follow the instructions to cancel. You can also request assistance at https://getsupport.apple.com. Similarly, if you subscribed on Google Play, cancellation is handled by Google. To cancel a purchase made through Google Play, launch the Google Play app on your mobile device and go to Menu &gt; My Apps &gt; Subscriptions, then find your Idius subscription and follow the instructions to cancel. You can also request assistance at&nbsp;<a href="about%3Ablank">https://play.google.com</a>. If you cancel a subscription, you may continue to use the cancelled service until the end of your then-current subscription term. The subscription will not be renewed when your then-current term expires.</p>

            <p>If you initiate a chargeback or otherwise reverse a payment made with your External Service Account, Idius may terminate your account immediately in its sole discretion. Idius will retain all funds charged to your External Service Account until you cancel your subscription through your External Service Account. Certain users may be entitled to request a refund. See Section 8b below for more information.</p>

            <p>Generally, all purchases are final and nonrefundable, and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods, except if the laws applicable in your jurisdiction provide for refunds.</p>

            <p><strong>9. DISCLAIMER</strong></p>

            <p>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT Idius DOES NOT CONDUCT CRIMINAL BACKGROUND OR IDENTITY VERIFICATION CHECKS ON ITS USERS OR OTHERWISE INQUIRE INTO THE BACKGROUND OF ITS USERS. Idius MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AS TO THE CONDUCT, IDENTITY, INTENTIONS, LEGITIMACY, OR VERACITY OF USERS. Idius RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT—AND YOU AUTHORIZE Idius TO CONDUCT—ANY CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK OR OTHER SCREENINGS (SUCH AS SEX OFFENDER REGISTER SEARCHES) AT ANY TIME USING AVAILABLE PUBLIC RECORDS, AND YOU AGREE THAT ANY INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE MAY BE USED FOR THAT PURPOSE. IF THE COMPANY DECIDES TO CONDUCT ANY SCREENING THROUGH A CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY, YOU HEREBY AUTHORIZE THE COMPANY AND ITS AUTHORIZED AGENTS &nbsp;TO OBTAIN AND USE A CONSUMER REPORT ABOUT YOU TO DETERMINE YOUR ELIGIBILITY UNDER THESE TERMS.</p>

            <p>YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER USERS. SEX OFFENDER SCREENINGS AND OTHER TOOLS DO</p>
            <p>NOT GUARANTEE YOUR SAFETY AND ARE NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR FOLLOWING THE&nbsp;SAFETY TIPS&nbsp;AND OTHER SENSIBLE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS. ALWAYS USE YOUR BEST JUDGMENT AND TAKE APPROPRIATE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS WHEN COMMUNICATING WITH OR MEETING NEW PEOPLE. COMMUNICATIONS RECEIVED THROUGH THE SERVICE, INCLUDING AUTOMATIC NOTIFICATIONS SENT BY Idius, MAY RESULT FROM USERS ENGAGING WITH THE SERVICE FOR IMPROPER PURPOSES, INCLUDING FRAUD, ABUSE, HARASSMENT, OR OTHER SUCH IMPROPER BEHAVIOR.</p>

            <p>Idius PROVIDES OUR SERVICES ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, GRANTS NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE WITH RESPECT TO OUR SERVICES (INCLUDING ALL CONTENT CONTAINED THEREIN), INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. Idius DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT OUR SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR ERROR FREE, ANY DEFECTS OR ERRORS IN OUR SERVICES WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT ANY CONTENT OR INFORMATION YOU OBTAIN ON OR THROUGH OUR SERVICES WILL BE ACCURATE. FURTHERMORE, Idius MAKES NO GUARANTEES AS TO THE NUMBER OF ACTIVE USERS AT ANY TIME; USERS’ ABILITY OR DESIRE TO COMMUNICATE WITH OR MEET YOU, OR THE ULTIMATE COMPATIBILITY WITH OR CONDUCT BY USERS YOU MEET THROUGH THE SERVICES.</p>

            <p>Idius TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY CONTENT THAT YOU OR ANOTHER USER OR THIRD PARTY POSTS, SENDS, OR RECEIVES THROUGH OUR SERVICES NOR DOES Idius TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE IDENTITY, INTENTIONS, LEGITIMACY, OR VERACITY OF ANY USERS WITH WHOM YOU MAY COMMUNICATION THROUGH Idius. ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF OUR SERVICES IS ACCESSED AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK. Idius IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER HARDWARE, COMPUTER SOFTWARE, OR OTHER EQUIPMENT OR TECHNOLOGY INCLUDING, BUT WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGE FROM ANY SECURITY BREACH OR FROM ANY VIRUS, BUGS, TAMPERING, FRAUD, ERROR, OMISSION, INTERRUPTION, DEFECT, DELAY IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION, COMPUTER LINE OR NETWORK FAILURE, OR ANY OTHER TECHNICAL OR OTHER MALFUNCTION.</p>

            <p>THE FOREGOING SHALL APPLY EVEN IF WE WERE ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IF YOU BECOME DISSATISFIED IN ANY WAY WITH THE APP OR SITE, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO STOP YOUR USE OF THE APP AND SITE.</p>

            <p>YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE APP OR SITE. BECAUSE SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE DISCLAIMER OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN TYPES OF DAMAGES, THESE PROVISIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY HEREIN IS A FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN AND REFLECTS A FAIR ALLOCATION OF RISK. THE APP AND SITE WOULD NOT BE PROVIDED WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS AND YOU AGREE THAT THE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMERS AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES SPECIFIED HEREIN WILL SURVIVE EVEN IF FOUND TO HAVE FAILED IN THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>


            <p><strong>11.DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT</strong></p>

            <p>Idius has adopted the following policy towards copyright infringement in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”). If you believe any Member Content or Our Content infringes upon your intellectual</p>
            <p>property rights, please submit a notification alleging such infringement (“DMCA</p>
            <p>Takedown Notice”) including the following:</p>

            <p>1. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;</p>
            <p>2. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works;</p>
            <p>3. Identification of the material claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material;</p>
            <p>4. Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail;</p>
            <p>5. A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</p>
            <p>6. A statement that, under penalty of perjury, the information in the notification is accurate and you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</p>

            <p><strong>12.LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</strong></p>

            <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL BECON, ITS AFFILIATES, EMPLOYEES, LICENSORS, OR SERVICE PROVIDERS BE LIABL E FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM: (I) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES, (II) THE CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES ON, THROUGH, OR FOLLOWING USE OF THE SERVICES; OR (III) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR CONTENT, EVEN IF Idius HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

            <p>SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
            
            <p><strong>13.DISPUTE RESOLUTION</strong></p>

            <p>If you are dissatisfied with our Services for any reason, please contact Idius Customer Service first so that we can try to resolve your concerns without the need of outside assistance. If you choose to pursue a claim against Idius, these terms will apply.</p>

The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any alleged breach thereof) or our Services shall be BINDING ARBITRATION administered by JAMS under the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures, except as modified by our&nbsp;Arbitration Procedures. The one exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that either party has the right to bring an individual claim against the other in a small-claims court of competent jurisdiction, or, if filed in arbitration, the responding party may request that the dispute proceed in small claims court if the party’s claim is within the jurisdiction of the small claims court. If the responding party requests to proceed in small claims court before the appointment of the arbitrator, the arbitration shall be administratively closed, and if requested after the appointment of the arbitrator, the arbitrator shall determine if the dispute should be decided in arbitration or if the arbitration should be administratively closed and decided in small claims court. Whether you choose arbitration or small-claims court, you may not under any circumstances commence or maintain against the Company any class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding.</p>

            <p>2. By using our Services in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration agreement. In doing so, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend any claims between you and the Company (except for matters that may be taken to small-claims court). YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY, and the arbitrator shall determine all issues regarding the arbitrability of the dispute. You are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator. The arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, but you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. For details on the arbitration process, see our&nbsp;Arbitration Procedures.</p>

            <p>3. Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that this arbitration agreement is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against the Company (except for small-claims court actions) may be commenced only in the federal or state courts located in Dallas County, Texas. You hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes.</p>

            <p>4. The online dispute settlement platform of the European Commission is available under&nbsp;http://ec.europa.eu/odr. Idius does not take part in dispute settlement procedures in front of a consumer arbitration entity for users residing in the EU or European Economic Area.</p>
            
            <p><strong>14b. GOVERNING LAW</strong></p>

            <p>Except for users residing in the EU or European Economic Area or elsewhere where our arbitration agreement is prohibited by law, the laws of Texas, U.S.A., excluding Texas’s conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement or our Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Arbitration Agreement in Section 15a above shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. For the avoidance of doubt, the choice of Texas governing law shall not supersede any mandatory consumer protection legislation in such jurisdictions.</p>

            <p><strong>15c. VENUE</strong></p>

            <p>Except for users residing in the EU or European Economic Area, who may bring claims in their country of residence in accordance with applicable law, and except for claims that may be properly brought in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction in the county or other jurisdiction in which you reside or in Dallas County, Texas, all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement, to our Services, or to your relationship with Idius that for whatever reason are not submitted to arbitration will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Dallas County, Texas, U.S.A. You and Idius consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of courts in the State of Texas and waive any claim that such courts constitute an inconvenient forum.</p>

            <p><strong>15.INDEMNITY&nbsp;</strong></p>

            <p>You agree, to the extent permitted under applicable law, to indemnify, defend, release, and hold harmless Idius, our affiliates, and their and our respective partners, licensors, affiliates, contractors, officers, directors, agents, representative, and employees from and against any and all third party actions, proceedings, complaints, demands, claims, damages (actual and/or consequential), losses, costs, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees), including attorney’s fees,&nbsp;suffered or reasonably incurred by us arising as a result of, or in connection with:</p>
